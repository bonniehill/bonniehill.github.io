    <div class="p-plus1 p-text1">Lukewarm is a 1997 e-zine turned physical publication. In this comparative version, Twitter posts have been placed in conjunction with the short stories to show the similarities in obscure humour between 1997 and 2019. Many of the stories in this zine hold sarcastic and dark undertones and have been paired with a selection of "meme aesthetic" images from the internet that loosely complement each zine issue.

      Little ones, do not be discouraged with impotence in your life, but trust in Jesus and remain steadfast in your onanism. I am here to bring you closer to Jesus’ bed and He will bring you to the Father for “sloppy seconds”.

    <div class="p-plus7 p-text7"> DEBBIE? About that night I cracked up your new BMW over a concrete traffic barrier on Lake Shore Drive, I’m really sorry. What a horrible accident. When I crawled out the window you were still unconscious. I tried to pull you through, but your foot was stuck in the glove compartment. So I went to get help. I was less than 50 feet away when the gas tank exploded. Wow Wee!
